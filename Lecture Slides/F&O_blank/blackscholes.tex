% Black-Scholes Model}

%
%   The classical Black-Scholes model is
%
%   $dB(t) = \DSE r B(t) dt, \A B(0)= 1$
%   $dS(t) = \DSE S(t) (b dt + \sigma dW(t) \!, \A &S(0) = p$
%
% with constant coefficients $b \in \setR,\; r,\s \in \setR_+$.

European Call Price
	For a European call $X = (S(T)-K)^+$ and  we can evaluate the
	above expected value

	The Black-Scholes price
	pro\-cess of a European call is given by
		$$
		\begin{array}{lll}
		C(t) &=&\DSE S(t) \Phi(d_1(S(t), T-t))\\*[12pt]
		&&- K e^{-r(T-t)} \Phi(d_2(S(t), T-t)).
		\end{array}
		$$
	
	The functions $d_1(s,t)$ and $d_2(s,t)$ are given by
		$$
		\begin{array}{lll}
		d_1(s,\tau) &=&\DSE \frac{\log(s/K) + (r +
		\frac{\sigma^2}{2})\tau}{\sigma \sqrt{\tau}},\\*[12pt] d_2(s,\tau) &=&\DSE
		 \frac{\log(s/K) + (r -
		\frac{\sigma^2}{2})\tau}{\sigma \sqrt{\tau}}
		\end{array}
		$$


\subsection{The Greeks}
Greeks (1)
	We will now analyse the impact of the underlying parameters in the standard Black-Scholes model on the
	prices of call and put options.
	
	The Black-Scholes option values depend on the
		(current) stock price,
		the volatility,
		the time to maturity,
		the interest rate
		the strike price.


Greeks (2)
	The sensitivities of the option price with respect to the first four
	parameters are called the {\it Greeks} and are widely used for
	hedging purposes.

	We can determine the impact of these parameters by taking partial derivatives.


Greeks
	$$
	\begin{array}{lllll}
	\Delta &:=&\DSE \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} &=&\DSE \Phi(d_1) >
	0,\\*[12pt] 
	{\cal V} &:=&\DSE \frac{\partial C}{\partial \s} &=&
	\DSE S \sqrt{\tau} \varphi(d_1) >0,\\*[12pt]
	 \Theta &:=&\DSE \frac{\partial
	C}{\partial \tau} &=& \DSE \frac{S \s}{2 \sqrt{\tau}} \varphi(d_1) + K r
	e^{-r\tau} \Phi(d_2) >0,\\*[12pt] 
	\rho &:=&\DSE \frac{\partial
	C}{\partial r} &=& \DSE \tau K e^{-r\tau} \Phi(d_2) >0,\\*[12pt] \Gamma
	&:=&\DSE \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2} &=& \DSE
	\frac{\varphi(d_1)}{S \s \sqrt{\tau}} >0.\\*[12pt]
	\end{array}
	$$
	

Greeks 
	From the definitions it is clear that
		$\Delta$ -- delta -- measures the change in the value of the
		option compared with the change in the value of the underlying
		asset,
 
		${\cal V}$ -- vega -- measures the change of the option
		compared with the change in the volatility of the underlying,
		similar statements hold for $\Theta$ -- theta -- and $\rho$ -- rho

	\includegraphics<1>[height=7cm]{../../../pics/gamma.pdf}

	\includegraphics<1>[height=7cm]{../../../pics/Vega2.pdf}

Greeks
	The Black-Scholes partial differential equation can be used to
	obtain the relation between the Greeks,

	$$
	r C = \frac{1}{2} s^2 \s^2 \Gamma +rs \Delta -\Theta.
	$$


Vega
	Before we can implement the Black-Scholes formula to price options, we have to estimate $\s$.

	Because the formula is explicit, we can, determine the ${\cal V}$ -- the partial derivative
		$$
		{\cal V} = \partial C/\partial \s,
		$$
	finding
		$$
		{\cal V} = S \sqrt{T} \Phi(d_1).
		$$
	Note here is that vega is always positive.


\subsection{Volatility}

Implied Volatility
	Since vega is positive, $C$ is a continuous -- indeed,
	differentiable -- strictly increasing function of $\s$.
 
	Turning this round, $\s$ is a continuous (differentiable) strictly
	increasing function of $C$; indeed,
		$$
		{\cal V} = \frac{\partial C}{\partial \s}, \A \mbox{so} \A
		\frac{1}{\cal V} = \frac{\partial \s}{\partial C}.
		$$

	Thus the value $\s = \s(C)$ corresponding to the actual value $C =
	C(\s)$ at which call options are observed to be traded in the
	market can be read off.  The value of $\s$ obtained in this way is
	called the {\it implied volatility}.


The Black-Scholes Implied Volatility
	The Black-Scholes model assumes a constant volatility over all maturities and strikes.
	
	One can calculate the implicit volatility given the market price of options.
	
	The implicit volatility is changing over time and maturity, so contradicting the modelling assumptions.
	
	However, it can be used to predict future volatility.
	
	Furthermore, volatility can be made an own "asset class".

VDAX-NEW: Definition
	The volatility index VDAX-NEW was developed by Deutsche B{\"o}rse and Goldman Sachs. 
	It tracks the degree of fluctuation expected by the derivatives market, i.e. the implied volatility, 
	for the DAX index. The index expresses in percentage terms what degree of volatility is to be expected 
	for the following 30 days.
  
	VDAX-NEW started on 20 April 2005 and will replace VDAX in the medium-term.


VDAX-NEW: Examples
	Examples:\\
		A DAX of 4,000 and a VDAX-NEW of 10 indicate that the DAX stock index is expected to fluctuate between 3,885 and 4,115 over the next thirty days:
		$$4000\pm4000\times0.1\times\sqrt{\frac{30}{365}}\approx4000\pm115.$$
   
		A DAX of 4,000 and a VDAX-NEW of 20 indicate that the DAX stock index is expected to fluctuate between 3,770 and 4,230 over the next thirty days:
    $$4000\pm4000\times0.2\times\sqrt{\frac{30}{365}}\approx4000\pm230.$$


VDAX-NEW

	$$\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../../../pics/VDaxNew.png}$$


VDAX-NEW: Calculation
	Index is based on 8 sub-indices (option series) which include DAX Options from 2-24 months expiration.
  
	The main rolling index is calculated 30 days to expiration on linear interpolation of the two sub-indices closest to the 30 days expiration.
  
	In addition to at-the-money options (VDAX), out-of-the-money options are also considered (VDAX-NEW).
  
	Calculation frequency: Once a minute on every trading day at Eurex between 8.50am and 5.30pm CET.


VDAX-NEW: Features
	Expresses market expectation of the amplitude of fluctuation in DAX.
  
	Index is able to react only to changes in volatility.
  
	Allows better replication for derivatives and structured products.
  
	Due to ATM and OTM options VDAX-NEW captures more of the volatility skew than VDAX.
  
	Index establishes volatiliy as a tradable and separate asset class for investors.


VDAX-NEW: Use
	Investment/Trading: Speculation on future levels of volatility.
	
	Hedging: Cover short volatility positions.
  
	Diversification of German equity portfolios (correlation to DAX is -0.5689, correlation to MDAX is -0.4668).
  
	Benchmark for German equity volatility.


VDAX-NEW: Diversification
	Portfolio of 80\% DAX and 20\% VDAX-NEW between
	1992 and 2004 would have generated a 3.8 percentage
	points on average higher yield than investments in
	DAX only. And this with lower risk!
