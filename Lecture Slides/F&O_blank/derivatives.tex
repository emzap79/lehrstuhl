\subsection{Modelling Assumptions}

Derivative Background (1)
	A derivative security, or contingent claim, is a financial contract whose value
		
		at expiration date $T$ (more briefly, expiry) is determined exactly \index{contingent claim} by the price (or
		prices within a prespecified time-interval) of
	
		the underlying financial assets (or instruments) at time $T$ (within the time
		interval $[0,T]$).


Derivative Background (2)
	Derivative securities can be grouped under three general headings:
	{\it Options, Forwards and Futures} and {\it Swaps}.
	
	During this lectures we will encounter all this structures and further variants.


Modelling Assumptions (1)
	We impose the following set of assumptions on the financial markets:
	
		{\it No market frictions: } No transaction costs, no bid/ask spread, no taxes,
		no margin requirements, no restrictions on short sales.\\*[12pt]
 
		{\it No default risk:} Implying same interest for borrowing and lending

		{\it Competitive markets:}  Market participants act as price takers, infinite number of participants\\*[12pt]
 
		{\it Rational agents} Market participants prefer more to less


Arbitrage (1)
	The concept of arbitrage lies at the centre of the relative pricing theory. All we need to assume
	additionally is that economic agents prefer more to less, or more precisely, an increase in 
	consumptionwithout any costs will always be accepted.


Arbitrage (2)
	The essence of the technical sense of arbitrage is that it should
	not be possible to guarantee a profit without exposure to risk.
	Were it possible to do so, arbitrageurs would do so, in unlimited quantity,
	using the market as a \lq {money-pump}' to extract arbitrarily
	large quantities of riskless profit.
  
	{\it We assume that arbitrage opportunities do not exist!}

 
Continuous and Discrete Compounding}
	Discrete compounding applies when we consider discrete time points, i.e. interest payments at the end of a period.\\
		$S_t = S_0 (1+r)^t$
  
	Continuous compounding applies when interest payments are done at a constant rate through the time period. \\
    $S_t = S_0e^{rt}$
      

Derivate Markets
	Financial derivatives are basically traded in two ways: on organized exchanges and over-the counter (OTC).
	
  Products at exchanges are standardized contracts that are defined by the exchange. Important exchanges for 
	commodities are the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in London 
	or the European Energy Exchange (EEX) in Leipzig.
  
	OTC trading takes place via computers and phones between various commercials and investment banks. OTC 
	contracts are non-standardized and can be flexible adjusted to the demand of the parties.


Underlying Securities
	Stocks (one or several);
	
	Fixed income instruments: T-Bonds, Interest Rates (LIBOR, EURIBOR);
	
	Commodities or Commodity Futures;
	
	Currencies (FX);
	
	Also Derivatives may be used as underlying for compound derivatives (call on call).


\subsection{Options}

Options
	An option is a financial instrument giving one the {\it right, but
	not the obligation} to make a specified transaction at (or by) a
	specified date at a specified price. 
	
	{\it Call} options give one the right to buy. {\it Put} options give one the right to sell.
	
	{\it European} options give one the right to buy/sell on the
	specified date, the expiry date, on which the option expires or
	matures. {\it American} options give one the right to buy/sell at any time
	prior to or at expiry.


Exotic Options
	Many kinds of options now exist, including so-called {\it exotic}
	options.  Types include:
		{\it Asian} options, which depend on the {\it average} price over a period,
		
		{\it barrier} options, which depend on some price level being attained or not.
		
		{\it lookback} options, which depend on the  {\it maximum} or {\it minimum} price over a period.


Options - Terminology (1)
	The asset to which the option refers is called the {\it underlying
	asset} or the {\it underlying}. 
 
	The price at which the transaction
	to buy/sell the underlying, on/by the expiry date (if exercised),
	is made, is called the {\it exercise price} or {\it strike price}.
	
	We shall usually use $K$ for the strike price, time $t = 0$ for
	the initial time (when the contract between the buyer and the
	seller of the option is struck), time $t = T$ for the expiry or
	final time.


Options - Terminology (2)
	Consider, say, a European call option, with strike price $K$;
	write $S(t)$ for the value (or price) of the underlying at time
	$t$.\\*[12pt]
		If $S(t) > K$, the option is {\it in the money},
		if $S(t) = K$, the option is {\it at the money},
		if $S(t) < K$, the option is {\it out of the money}.


Options - Payoff
	The payoff from a call option is $$ S(T) - K \mbox{ if } S(T)
	> K\A \mbox{ and }\A 0 \;\; \mbox{otherwise} $$ (more briefly
	written as  $(S(T) - K)^+$).
	
	The profit from a call option is the payoff $(S(T) - K)^+$) minus the call premium $c$.


Options - Payoff/Profit diagram 
	Considering only the option payoff, we obtain the payoff diagram, taking into account the initial payment of an investor one obtains the profit diagram below.\\*[12pt]

\subsection{Forwards and Futures}

Forwards - Basic Structure
	A {\it forward contract} is an agreement to buy or sell an asset $S$ at a certain future
	date $T$ for a certain price $K$.

	The agent who agrees to buy the underlying asset is said to have a {\it long} position,
	the other agent assumes a {\it short} position.
	
	The settlement date is called {\it delivery date} and the specified price is
	referred to as {\it delivery price}.


Forwards
	The {\it forward price} $F(t,T)$ is the delivery price which would make the
	contract have zero value at time $t$.
	
	At the time the contract is set up, $t=0$, the forward price therefore equals 
	the delivery price, hence $F(0,T) = K$.
	
	The forward prices $F(t,T)$ need not (and will not) necessarily be equal 
	to the delivery price $K$ during the life-time of the contract.


Forwards
	The payoff from a long position in a forward contract on one unit
	of an asset with price $S(T)$ at the maturity of the contract is
	$$ S(T)-K.$$
 
	Compared with a call option with the same maturity
	and strike price $K$ we see that the investor now faces a downside
	risk, too. He has the obligation to buy the asset for price $K$.


Spot-Forward Relationship
	Under the no-arbitrage assumption we have
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}[ht]{|l|c|c|}
			\hline
			$$ & $t$ & $T$\\
			\hline\hline
			buy stock & $-S(t)$ & delivery\\
			borrow to finance & $S(t)$ & $-S(t)e^{r(T-t)}$\\
			sell forward on S & $$ & $F(t,T)$\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	All quantities are known at $t$, the time $t$ cashflow is zero, so the cashflow at T needs to be zero so we have $$F(t,T) = S(t)e^{r(T-T)}$$

	\end{center}


Futures
	Futures can be defined as standardised forward contracts traded at exchanges where a clearing house acts as a central counterparty for all transactions.
	
	Usually an initial margin is paid as a guarantee.
	
	Each trading day a settlement price is determined and gains or losses are immediately realized at a margin account.
	
	Thus credit risk is eliminated, but there is exposure to interest rate risk.

Swaps
	A {\it swap} is an agreement whereby two parties
	undertake to exchange, at known dates in the future, various
	financial assets (or cash flows) according to a prearranged
	formula that depends on the value of one or more underlying
	assets. 

	Examples are currency swaps (exchange currencies) and
	interest-rate swaps (exchange of fixed for floating set of
	interest payments).
