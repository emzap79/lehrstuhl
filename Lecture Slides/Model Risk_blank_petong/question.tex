	{\bf Q1}



% begin itemize





	
Describe the difference between a Bayesian Model Averaging and a Utility-based Worst-Case
approach.


	Assume that you need to price a derivative instrument in an incomplete market situation. What is Cont's suggestion to measure model risk?


	
Consider in a basic GBM world the pricing of a call option with maturity $T$.
Assume alternative diffusion models
\begin{equation}
\Q_i\;:\; dS(t) = S(t)(r dt + \sigma_i(t) dW(t))
\end{equation}
where $ \sigma_i: [0,t] \rightarrow [0, \infty[ $ is a bounded deterministic volatility function.
We observe prices of a traded European call (strike $K$, maturity $T$) with prices $C^*$ and
$\Sigma$ the implied Black-Scholes volatility.

Formulate the calibration condition for the given models.


	
Let $0< T_1 <T$ and consider two models. The first on with constant volatility $\sigma_1$ and the second one with a volatility $\sigma_2 < \sigma _1$ for $0 \leq t <T_1$ and a constant volatility for $T_1\leq t \leq T$. Specify  the  volatilities of the models in terms of the implied volatility $\Sigma $.


	
Consider the $\Delta$ at $t=0$ and $t=T_1$ for both models for the European call with maturity $T$. Which is more sensitive to changes of the underlying at $t=0$ and $t=T_1$?

	{\bf Solution}



% begin itemize





	
Describe the difference between a Bayesian Model Averaging and a Utility-based Worst-Case
approach.

{\it Answer:} The Bayesian Model is calculates model dependent quantities by averaging over  expectation of the models. The worst-case approach has its foundations in the {\it MaxMin} approach as a robust version of expected utility. Assume $U$ is a utility function, then
the worst case approach considers
$\max _X \min_{\prob \in {\cal P}} \EX_{\prob}(U(X))$.



	Assume that you need to price a derivative instrument in an incomplete market situation. What is Cont's suggestion to measure model risk?

{\it Answer:}
For $X$ a derivative we associate with
$\Gamma(X)$ the ask price and with $-\Gamma(-X)$ its bid price.
Cont's suggestion is
$$
\Gamma^u(X)=\sup_{\Q \in {\cal Q}} \EX_{\Q} \; \mbox{ and } \;
\Gamma^l(X)= -\Gamma^u(-X)=\inf_{\Q \in {\cal Q}} \EX_{\Q}.
$$
Cont measures the model risk as
$$
\Gamma^u(X)-
\Gamma^l(X).
$$



	
Consider in a basic GBM world the pricing of a call option with maturity $T$.
Assume alternative diffusion models
\begin{equation}
\Q_i\;:\; dS(t) = S(t)(r dt + \sigma_i(t) dW(t))
\end{equation}
where $ \sigma_i: [0,t] \rightarrow [0, \infty[ $ is a bounded deterministic volatility function.
We observe prices of a traded European call (strike $K$, maturity $T$) with prices $C^*$ and
$\Sigma$ the implied Black-Scholes volatility.



% begin itemize





	
Formulate the calibration condition for the given models.

{\it Answer:}
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T  \sigma_i(s)^2 ds = \Sigma^2,
\end{equation}


	
Let $0< T_1 <T$ and consider two models. The first one with constant volatility $\sigma_1$ and the second one with a volatility $\sigma_2 < \sigma _1$ for $0 \leq t <T_1$ and a constant volatility for $T_1\leq t \leq T$. Specify  the  volatilities of the models in terms of the implied volatility $\Sigma $.

{\it Answer:}
$$
\sigma_1 = \Sigma,
$$
\sigma_2(t) = \sigma_2 \IF_{[0,T_1]}+ \sqrt{\frac{T\Sigma^2 -T_1\sigma_2^2}{T-T_1}}\IF_{]T_1, T]}.
$$


	
Consider the $\Delta$ at $t=0$ and $t=T_1$ for both models for the European call with maturity $T$. Which is more sensitive to changes of the underlying at $t=0$ and $t=T_1$?

{\it Answer:}
We know
\begin{align*}
  \Delta = \frac{\partial}{\partial S}Call_{BS}(S,K,\sigma,r,t,T) = \Phi(d_1)
\end{align*}
where, as usual, $\Phi$ denotes the c.d.f. of the standard normal distribution and
\begin{align*}
  d_1 = \frac{\log \left( \frac{S}{K} \right) + \left( r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}
  \right)(T-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T-t}}.
\end{align*}
At $t=0$ both models have the same $\Delta$ as they are both valued with the implied volatility $\Sigma$.
At $t=T_1$ the  $\Delta$ of model 2 is higher as the remaining volatility is higher. So it is more sensitive.



	
Consider  a  European call with strike $K$ and maturity $T_1$. What is Cont's measure of model risk for this option regarding the two models.

{\it Answer:}
By monotonicity of the BS-formula in terms of volatility the Cont model bounds are
$$
\Gamma^u(X)=C^{BS}(K, T_1; \sigma_1)  \A \Gamma^l(X)=C^{BS}(K, T_1; \sigma_2).$$
