\subsection{Carbon Bonds}

% frametitle
{Carbon Revenue Bonds}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> To finance high initial cost for Renewable Energy (RE) projects future returns of the project are securitized
\item<2->
\begin{itemize}
\item Sell future electricity from RE project
\item Sell environmental credits from RE project
\end{itemize}
\item<3-> Only revenue from environmental credits is used for bond
\item<4-> Rigorous forecast analysis of revenues, sensitivity tests and risk analysis is required.
\end{itemize}




% frametitle
{Structure of Bond}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> pass-through: all revenues are directly passed trough to the owner of the bond
\item<2->
\begin{itemize}
\item maturity: T
\item revenues in year 1: $c_i$
\item rate of return: $r$
\item initial price: $x$
\end{itemize}
\item<3-> Fair price
$$
x= \sum_{i=1}^T \frac{c_i}{(1+r)^i}
$$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Impact of Carbon Markets on Investment Markets}


% frametitle
{Financial Implications of Carbon Policies}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Modern risk management has to include the consequences of climate change.
\item<2-> Regulatory risk (reduction targets for carbon emissions) transforms into financial risk  for several asset classes.
\item<3-> Carbon inefficient firms tend to have a higher credit spread and higher refinancing costs.
\end{itemize}



% frametitle
{Factors Affecting Carbon Risk}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Energy intensity and fuel mix -- firms that are dependent on fossil fuels face higher costs.
\item<2-> Direct, indirect and embedded emissions of a firm's product affect market position.
\item<3-> Marginal abatement costs.
\item<4-> Technology trajectory -- progress in adapting low-carbon emission technologies.
\end{itemize}



% frametitle
{Motivation for Investors to Invest in Carbon-related Assets}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Financial Motivation
\begin{itemize}
\item Portfolio diversification
\item Potential fundamental price appreciation of carbon
\item Hedging financial risk due to carbon price increases
\end{itemize}
\item<2-> Green Motivation
\begin{itemize}
\item Compliance with UN principles of responsible investment (UN PRI)
\item Public opinion, behaviour as corporate citizen
\item Incentivizing the corporate sector by taking carbon credits from the market
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



% frametitle
{Risk In Renewable Energy Companies}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Costs: as the costs of producing RE come down while the costs of producing fossil fuels rise, a
substitution will occur.
\item<2-> Capital: Government and private capita
\item<3-> Competition: between governments as they try to build greener economies
\item<4-> China: huges efforts to establish a green economy
\item<5-> Consumers: demand products with less impact on the economy
\item<6-> Climate Change: will be tackled by investment in greener technologies.
\end{itemize}



% frametitle
{CAPM Analysis of RE Companies}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Empirical evidence shows that RE companies have a $\beta$ close to two.
\item<2-> Model: $i$ firm, $t$ time
$$
R_{it}= \alpha_i + \beta_{it} R_{mt}+\epsilon_{it}
$$
$R$ returns, $\alpha$ component that is independent of the market.
\item<3-> Higher beta values indicate a higher equity cost of capital.Investors must then be compensated
through higher expected returns in order to take on the higher risk. A higher equity cost of capital can affect borrowing costs and
it can also affect the discount rate used in net present value calculations.
\end{itemize}



% frametitle
{CAPM Analysis of RE Companies II}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Which factors affect systematic risk (the $\beta$)?
\item<2-> Empirical analysis shows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Increases in sales growth reduce market risk
\item Increases in oil price returns increases systematic risk
\end{itemize}
\item<3-> In order to foster RE companies governments can implement policies to increase sales of such companies (e.g. PV-industry and feed-in tariffs).
\end{itemize}
