% frametitle
{Project-based Mechanisms}
% begin itemize
\item<1-> 2005:  Emissions Trading (EU ETS) was launched in the European Union as a measure to meet the Kyoto commitment
\item<2-> Flexible Mechanisms as Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) can be used by countries to meet their Kyoto commitment and also by companies within the framework of EU emissions trading
% end itemize
Objectives of CDM/JI
% begin itemize
\item<1-> To save the same or a higher amount of CO2 for the same financial effort and by using fewer financial resources (abatement costs are lower)
\item<2-> Sustainability, emissions reduction, technology transfer, contribution towards economic development

% frametitle
{Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)}
% begin itemize
\item <1-> Emission reduction projects in a developing or an emerging country (e.g. China, India, Brazil, Malaysia)
\item <2-> Accepted technologies (photovoltaic, wind power, biomass, energy efficiency; no nuclear projects!)
\item <3-> Projects generate Certified Emission Reductions (CER) in the amount of tonnes of emissions that have been avoided (compared to the 'business-as-usual'-scenario, that means claim for additionality)
% end itemize
\textbf{Secondary CERs:} issued, tradable credits with guaranteed delivery \\
\textbf{Primary CERs:} purchased forward directly from project (or fonds), subject to individual project and delivery risks

							% Folie 6

% frametitle
{Joint Implementation (JI)}
% begin itemize
\item <1-> Emission reduction projects in an industrialized or a transition country (e.g. Russia, Ukraine), which has committed to a cap, solely in sectors not covered in the ETS
\item <2-> Analogous to CDM, but reduces the emission budget of the country where the project takes place
\item <3-> Projects generate ERU (Emissions Reduction Unit) in the amount of the avoided emissions (compared to the 'business-as-usual'-scenario)
\item <4-> from 2008 onwards accepted in the EU ETS
% end itemize
CERs and ERUs can be used by \\
1) Countries, for compliance under the Kyoto Protocol \\
2) Companies within the EU ETS (up to 22\%), for compliance

% end itemize

% frametitle
{CDM/JI Risk Management Example}
% begin itemize
\item<1-> We combine a CDM project with an ERPA
\item<2-> Recall an Emission Reduction Purchase Argreement (ERPA) is a  transaction that transfers carbon credits between two parties under the Kyoto Protocol. The buyer pays the seller cash in exchange for carbon credits, thereby allowing the purchaser to emit more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
\item<3-> Assume an ERPA with $10$ \euro/ t CO2
% end itemize

% frametitle
{CDM/JI Risk Management Example II}
% begin itemize
\item<1-> Sell the expected volume $V_{exp}$ of 50 000 t CO2 forward at $15$ \euro /t CO2
\item<2-> Now the volume delivered is a random variable $V$ and the certificate spot price $S$ is random.
\item<3-> So the portfolio value $P$ at delivery is
\begin{equation}\nonumber
P = 15 \times V_{exp} - 10 \times V + (S-15) \times (V_{exp}-V)^+ + S \times (V-V_{exp})^+
\end{equation}
\item<4-> So we face two risky scenarios
% begin itemize
\item Higher volume with low spot
\item lower volume with higher spot
