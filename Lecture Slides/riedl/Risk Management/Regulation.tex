\subsection{Overview of Solvency II}
\frame{\frametitle{ Aims of Solvency II}
Solvency II is one of the most important projects of the EU regulatory authorities. Its aim is to modernize the solvability requirements of
insurance companies towards a risk-based system. Insurance companies are required to improve (or even set up) their own risk management processes.
Currently, it does not seem possible that the deadline for implementation of
Solvency II---which is January, 1st 2013---can be met. Some parts of the rules
might not come into effect until January 2015.
}
\frame{\frametitle{Solvency I}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1->
Solvency I, currently in place, features simple rules for minimal capital requirements and solvency margins (16-18 \% of premium (non-life), 4 \% of
  technical provisions (life).
\item<2-> It is volume-based and not explicitly risk-based, i.e. no difference
is made between investment mixes or asset/liability profiles.
\end{itemize}

}
\frame{\frametitle{Aims Solvency II}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Risk based supervision (qualitative)
\item<2-> Adequate capital requirements according to individual risk profile (chance of using internal models)
\item<3-> More emphasis on risk management, internal controls \& Corporate Governance
\item<4-> Integration of models in risk management and internal control systems
\item<5-> Developing frameworks which enable comparison, transparency and consistency
\item<6-> Competition
\end{itemize}

}

\frame{\frametitle{Market-consistent valuation}
There are three classes of assets which are treated differently.
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Marking-to-market if liquid market exist. This includes government
  bonds, liquid shares, ...
\item<2-> Derived from prices of similar tracked instruments (mix of
  marking-to-market and marking-to-model). Here  illiquid bonds, real estate, ...
\item<3-> Finally, marking-to-model for participation, private equity, ...
\end{itemize}
}
\subsection{Levels of Capital requirement}
\frame{\frametitle{Solvency Margin}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1->
The concept of a
solvency margin can be seen as a buffer of free assets covering
the liabilities.
\item<2-> This buffer should consist of good-quality assets
which allow timely liquidation within a given time horizon (e.g. 1
year).
\item<3->We assume a "best estimate" of the liabilities of the
insurance company as given (e.g. by a fair value principle). Also,
the technical provisions should be calculated as best estimate.
\end{itemize}
}
\frame{\frametitle{Solvency Capital}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1->
On top of liabilities we put a prudent solvency margin.
\item<2-> This
should achieve a minimum capital requirement (MCR) and a solvency
capital requirement (SCR).
\item<3-> Both MCR and SCR are risk charges and
computed using an appropriate risk measure
\end{itemize}

}
\frame{\frametitle{Solvency Capital}
\begin{itemize}
  \item [\underline{SCR:}] this is a target level with no
  immediate intervention by the regulator. However, the insurer
  needs to convince the regulator of appropriate action to be
  taken (plan on how to restore the capital level)
  \item [\underline{MCR}] safety net; this is a hard solvency
  margin, with the objective of defining the level at which the
  management of the company is taken over by the supervisory
  authority.
 \end{itemize}
MCR and SCR are calculated in terms of an unknown distribution
function (giving the value of the SCR).

}
\frame{\frametitle{Risk Levels}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Level 0:} between risk exposures, for example volatility and non-volatility within a product
line or an asset category;
\item {\bf Level 1:} between sub-portfolios within a risk
category of a business unit for example, line-of-business or asset
category (bonds, equity, cash,...)
\item {\bf Level 2:} between main risk categories and
sub-risk classes (see below)
\item {\bf Level 3:} between business units to the group (consisting of several insurance
companies).
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Risk Categories}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1->
Main risk categories (level 2) are
Underwriting Risk (insurance risk), Credit Risk, Market Risk.
\item<2-> Operational Risk: risk of losses due to inadequate or
failing processes people and systems (e.g. fraud, risk from
external events)
\item<3-> Liquidity Risk: risk of loss due to the fact that
insufficient liquid assets are available to meet cash flow
requirements.
\end{itemize}

% \subsection{Stochastic Model}
\frame{\frametitle{Standard Model}
Our general framework will be a risk variable
$$X=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$ where $X_i$ are variables describing the
main risk categories. We need to take the distribution of $X_i$
and dependency between the $X_i'$s into account.

}

\frame{\frametitle{Model Parameters}
We assume $X=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$ with $\mathbb{E}(X)=\mu_x$,
$\var(X)=\sigma_x^2$ and $\mathbb{E}(X_i)=\mu_i$,
$\var(X_i)=\sigma_i^2$, $\Cor(X_i,X_j)=\rho_{ij}$.

The usual formulae apply
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(X)&=&\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbb{E}(X_i)\\
\var(X)&=&\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n\rho_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j
\end{align*}
}

\frame{\frametitle{The Case of Normality}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1->
Assume $X_i\sim {\cal N}(\mu_i,\sigma_i^2)$, then $X\sim
{\cal N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$
\item<2-> $VaR_{\alpha}(X)=\mu+q_{1-\alpha}\sigma$ with
$q_{1-\alpha}$ the $(1-\alpha)$-Quantile of the $N(0,1)$
distribution.
\end{itemize}
}
\frame{\frametitle{Correlation and Dependencies}

Typical risk categories are\\
\begin{tabular}{lll}
  % after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
  $C_1$ & : & asset risk \\
 $C_2$ & :& technical risk \\
  $C_3$ &: & interest risk\\
  $C_4$ & : & business risk \\
\end{tabular}\\
with correlations
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\rho(C_1,C_3)=1, &\rho(C_1,C_2)=0,\\*[12pt]
\rho(C_3,C_2)=0, & \rho(C_1,C_4)=\rho(C_2,C_4)=\rho(C_3,C_4)=1
\end{array}
$$
