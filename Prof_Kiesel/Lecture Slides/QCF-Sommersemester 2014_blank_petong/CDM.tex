\subsection{Carbon Bonds}

% frametitle
{Carbon Revenue Bonds}

% begin itemize

	To finance high initial cost for Renewable Energy (RE) projects future returns of the project are securitized

% begin itemize

	Sell future electricity from RE project

	Sell environmental credits from RE project

% end itemize

	Only revenue from environmental credits is used for bond

	Rigorous forecast analysis of revenues, sensitivity tests and risk analysis is required.

	pass-through: all revenues are directly passed trough to the owner of the bond

\subsection{Impact of Carbon Markets on Investment Markets}

% frametitle
{Financial Implications of Carbon Policies}

% begin itemize

	Modern risk management has to include the consequences of climate change.

	Regulatory risk (reduction targets for carbon emissions) transforms into financial risk  for several asset classes.

	Carbon inefficient firms tend to have a higher credit spread and higher refinancing costs.

% end itemize

% frametitle
{Factors Affecting Carbon Risk}

% begin itemize

	Energy intensity and fuel mix -- firms that are dependent on fossil fuels face higher costs.

	Direct, indirect and embedded emissions of a firm's product affect market position.

	Marginal abatement costs.

	Technology trajectory -- progress in adapting low-carbon emission technologies.

{Motivation for Investors to Invest in Carbon-related Assets}

% begin itemize

	Financial Motivation

% begin itemize

	Portfolio diversification

	Potential fundamental price appreciation of carbon

	Hedging financial risk due to carbon price increases

% end itemize

	Green Motivation

% begin itemize

	Compliance with UN principles of responsible investment (UN PRI)

	Public opinion, behaviour as corporate citizen

	Incentivizing the corporate sector by taking carbon credits from the market

% end itemize

{Risk In Renewable Energy Companies}

% begin itemize

	Costs: as the costs of producing RE come down while the costs of producing fossil fuels rise, a
substitution will occur.

	Capital: Government and private capita

	Competition: between governments as they try to build greener economies

	China: huges efforts to establish a green economy

	Consumers: demand products with less impact on the economy

	Climate Change: will be tackled by investment in greener technologies.

{CAPM Analysis of RE Companies}

% begin itemize

	Empirical evidence shows that RE companies have a $\beta$ close to two.

	Model: $i$ firm, $t$ time
$$
R_{it}= \alpha_i + \beta_{it} R_{mt}+\epsilon_{it}
$$
$R$ returns, $\alpha$ component that is independent of the market.

	Higher beta values indicate a higher equity cost of capital.Investors must then be compensated
through higher expected returns in order to take on the higher risk. A higher equity cost of capital can affect borrowing costs and
it can also affect the discount rate used in net present value calculations.

{CAPM Analysis of RE Companies II}

% begin itemize

	Which factors affect systematic risk (the $\beta$)?

	Empirical analysis shows:

% begin itemize

	Increases in sales growth reduce market risk

	Increases in oil price returns increases systematic risk

% end itemize

	In order to foster RE companies governments can implement policies to increase sales of such companies (e.g. PV-industry and feed-in tariffs).
