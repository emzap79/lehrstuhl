	Consider two companies A and B each emitting 100 000 metric tons of $\textnormal{CO}_2$ per year

	Each has been allocated 95 000 metric tons under its national allocation plan

	Credits are trading at 10\euro\ per metric ton

	Company A can cut 10 000 metric tons of emission at 5\euro\ per ton (marginal abatement costs, MAC)

	Company B has MAC of 15\euro\ per ton

	Company A receives 50 000\euro\ for its surplus and covers the costs of its own reduction

	Company B meets the cap at cost 50 000\euro\ instead of 75 000\euro

        The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) was the first mandatory cap-and-trade program in the United States to limit carbon dioxide (CO2) from the power sector. It consists of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

   California started an ETS in 2012.

	At the start of phase III in 2013 the surplus of allowances stood at almost two billion, double its level in early 2012.

	As a short-term measure, the Commission has posted the auctioning of 900 million allowances until 2019-2020 to allow demand to pick up.

   As back-loading is only a temporary measure, the Commission proposes to establish a market stability reserve at the beginning of the next trading period in 2021.

\subsection{ETS and Flexibility}

% frametitle
{{\it Where} flexibility}

% begin itemize

	The ambition should be a global market. However, there are various constraints such as policy differences, differences in the traded good, etc.

	Linking different national and regional trading systems can approximate a global market.

	Linking markets increases liquidity and thus reduces the cost of trading.

	However, different designs of schemes have to be taken into account.

{{\it When} flexibility  -- Banking}

% begin itemize

	effectively increases the depth and liquidity of the market, reducing price volatility by
making current prices a function of a longer time span of activity, rather than being
entirely determined by events today;

	creates an incentive for firms to take early action;

	firms with banked allowances have a
vested interest in higher prices and the continuation (and success) of the system, to maximise the value of
their allowance assets;

	banking can also prevent a price collapse between commitment
periods;

% end itemize

% frametitle
{{\it When} flexibility -- Borrowing}

% begin itemize

	the regulator may not be well-equipped to assess the credit worthiness and
solvency of firms who borrow allowances, who thereby become debtors;

	borrowing enables firms to delay action if they assume that targets will prove too
onerous and will subsequently be softened;

	firms with borrowed allowances have an active interest to lobby for weaker targets,
or even for scrapping emissions trading altogether, so that their debts are cancelled;

	the political desire to (be seen to) act early, and potential benefits of early action,
also imply that politicians may prefer to place constraints on borrowing;

% end itemize

% frametitle
{{\it When} flexibility}

% begin itemize

	banking is usually allowed between periods (Exemption EU ETS Phase I);

	there is typically no borrowing (or only very limited);

	when there are limits on borrowing between periods, the length of the commitment period is relevant to 'when' flexibility
and to market efficiency

% begin itemize

	investments to reduce
emissions may require many years for investors to recover their costs

future governments, and attempt to anticipate changes in the underlying structure of the
carbon trading framework

% end itemize

\subsection{ETS and Tax}

% frametitle
{ETS vs Tax: Generalities}

% begin itemize

	Since compliance costs are uncertain the choice of instrument depends on the relative curvatures
of the marginal benefit curve and the marginal abatement costs curve.

	In case of CO2, where damage does not depend on the flow of emissions but on their accumulation in
the atmosphere, scientific results suggest that a carbon tax is more economically efficient under
uncertainty than emissions trading.

	In practice, however, the analysis of efficiency
under uncertainty has had little influence on the choice of policy instruments. The preference
for carbon trading over carbon taxes is driven largely by powerful political economy concerns.
Trading systems are easier to implement politically.
  % end itemize

% frametitle
{ETS vs Tax}

% begin itemize

	The market for emission
reductions has a demand schedule, which is determined by the marginal abatement costs of
regulated agents, and a supply schedule, which is determined by policy.

	Under a pure tax
system, the supply of allowances is infinitely elastic. The market is effectively supplied with as
many allowances as agents wish to buy at a fixed price (the tax rate).

	Under a pure allowance
system, supply is completely inelastic as the amount of allowances is exogenously fixed.

	Hybrid systems create a supply curve that is neither fully flat (a pure tax) nor fully vertical
(pure cap-and-trade) but (stepwise) upward sloping.

% end itemize

% frametitle
{Price ceilings and price floors}

% begin itemize

	a price ceiling and floor provide significantly
greater clarity to investors to deliver dynamic efficiency (in the form of optimal investment
over longer time frames).

	the price floor would guarantee a certain minimum return on
investment in low-carbon technologies, reducing the risk faced by innovating firms.

	the price ceiling may enhance policy credibility. Because it caps the costs of
compliance, a ceiling reduces the risk of a policy reversal if abatement costs turn out to be
injuriously high.

% end itemize

% frametitle
{Price ceilings and price floors}

% begin itemize

	a price ceiling can be established through an unlimited commitment from the regulator to sell allowances onto the market at the price ceiling

	drawback: compliance with the emissions cap is sacrificed

	a price floor can be established
through an unlimited commitment from the regulator to buy back
allowances from the market at the price floor

	drawback: the floor would be achieved at the risk of
imposing a liability on the public balance sheet.

{Ecological Effectiveness}

% begin itemize

	Emission trading systems sets a cap, which in theory establishes precisely the level of emissions which is desired (100\% effectiveness)

	Tax system cannot guarantee an exact amount of emissions as an  outcome. The tax level is set under uncertainty about the marginal abatement costs.

	Hybrid systems reach the target value as long as the system is in its trade area. As soon as the trigger level is reached the ecological target becomes diluted due to the additional certificates.

% end itemize

% frametitle
{Political Feasibility}
Political feasibility is the level of acceptance a policy has in the public. A major factor is the number of people affected.

% begin itemize

	Emission trading systems have a good political enforceability since costumers feel no direct effect by government action.

	Price rises are blamed on companies, especially in case allocation is free. In case of auctioning extra government revenues can be used for redistribution.

	Tax systems are generally met with scepticism (especially in the US). Additional costs on emissions will effect consumers more directly via cost increases.

	Hybrid systems also generate an extra revenue after the trigger is met, which may be viewed positively.

% end itemize

\subsection{Multiple Policy Instruments}

% frametitle
{Multiple Instruments I}

% begin itemize

	Emission regulation is directed at internalizing externalities and economic theory indicates that only one instrument is needed to
internalize one externality.

	Policy often involves multiple instruments such as command-and-control regulation, subsidies, taxes, trading schemes, etc.

	This process reflects an ad-hoc policy-accretion process driven by the multiplicity of national institutions or ...

	the temptation of politician to fix everything.

% end itemize

% frametitle
{Multiple Policy Instruments II}

% begin itemize

	Combinations of permit trading schemes, carbon taxes, technology-specific subsidies and regulatory standards

	Taxes introduced by Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Ireland

	Subsidies for renewable energy by Germany, Spain

	Academic literature gives justification for multiple instruments used in a complimentary way, i.e. hybrid systems. Justification in terms of presence of multiple market failures, asymmetric information, principle-agent relation

% begin itemize

	 Carbon tax $t$ (Euro per tonne)

	 Cap-and-trade scheme with price $p$

	 Firm must pay tax and procure certificates for emissions
\begin{tabular}{ll}

$e$ & emissions after abatement \\

{Tax and Trade: optimization problem}

% begin itemize

	 Since $c'>0$ we can invert $e^*=e_0-c'^{-1}(t+p)=e^*(t,p)$ \\

	 Since $f''(e)=c''(e_0-e)>0$ it is a minimum \\

	 Differentiation of (*) w.r.t. the variable t:
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}c'(e_0-e^*(t,p))=\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}(t+p)
\]
\[
-c''(e-e^*(t,p)) \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}} (e^*(t,p))=1
\]
\[
e^*_t=-\frac{1}{c''} < 0
\]

	 Thus increases in tax reduce emissions; By symmetry $e^*_p = -\frac{1}{c''} < 0$ increases in price reduce emissions and $e^*_t=e^*_p$

% end itemize

{Tax and Trade: optimization problem}
Assume a cap $E$, $n$ identical firms, such that the aggregate emissions are $E=ne^*$. \\
For constant tax $t$ formally
\[
dE = ne^*_pdp \textnormal{, so } \frac{dp}{dE} = (ne^*_p)^{-1} < 0
\]
that is an increase in the cap reduces the price. \\
For fixed cap we have
\[
ne^*_tdt+ne^*_pdp=0
\]
\[
\frac{dp}{dt}=-\frac{e^*_t}{e^*_p}=-1.

That is ''a small increase in tax results one-for-one in an equivalent reduction of the permit price". \\

	 MAC to use (for example) wind generation is how much it costs to generate electricity by wind compared with the cheapest alternative. \\

\subsubsection{Asymmetric Policy Combinations}

% frametitle
{Uniliteral Tax and Trade}

% begin itemize

	Firms are identical

	Tax only affects a fraction $f$ of firms

	Uniliteral tax leads to diverging marginal costs and so increased mitigation costs.

% end itemize

% frametitle
{Unilateral tax and trade}

% begin itemize

	 Firms are identical with optimal emissions $e^*(t,p)$; $e^*_p = e^*_t = -\frac{1}{c''}$

	 Tax affects only a fraction of firms $f$ (a fraction of the system-wide emissions) $0 < f < 1$ \\
 So
\begin{align}
E = fne^*(t,p)+(1-f)ne^*(p)
\end{align}
Assuming
\[
e^{*f}_p = e^{*(1-f)}_p
\]
We find
\[
dE = fne^*_tdt+ne^*_pdp
\]

% end itemize

							% Folie 5

% frametitle
{Unilateral tax and trade}
Fix $E$, then the impact of the tax on the permit price is
\[
0 =  fe^*_tdt+e^*_pdp \Rightarrow \frac{dp}{dt} = -f \frac{e^*_t}{e^*_p} = -f
\]
The impact of the tax change on permit prices is diluted and different for the two categories
\[
\frac{de^{*f}}{dt} = e^{*f}_t + e^{*f}_p \frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{1}{c''} + (-\frac{1}{c''})(-f) = -(1-f)\frac{1}{c''} < 0
\]
\[
\frac{de^{*1-f}}{dt} = e^{*(1-f)}_p\frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{f}{c''} > 0
\]
So the emissions for firms subject to tax fall, but the emissions for firms with no tax increase.

							% Folie 6

% frametitle
{Unilateral tax and trade}
The impact on marginal costs for taxed firms is \\
(use $c'(e_0-e^*) = t+p)$)
\[
\frac{d(c^f)'}{dt} = \frac{dt}{dt} + \frac{dp}{dt} = 1-f > 0
\]
and for untaxed firms
\[
\frac{d(c^{1-f})'}{dt} = \frac{dp}{dt} = -f < 0
\]
Diverging marginal costs mean that the gains from trade are, at least in part, reversed. (Remember firms where identical, now mitigation costs increase.)
