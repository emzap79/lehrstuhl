{System Balancing}

% begin itemize

	The transmission system operator (TSO) has the task to match demand and supply (to balance the system).

	The TSO defines a balancing period (15 minutes in Germany), which is the granularity of the measured electric energy supply and during which a constant power supply takes place (by the energy merchant).

	The power balancing during the balancing period (not smaller than the granularity, in Germany an hour) is the task of the TSO.

	The TSO usually has no own generation capacities and has to act on the reserve market to compensate imbalances.

{Balancing and Reserve Markets}
We use the following definitions

% begin itemize

	Reserve Market: allows the TSO to purchase the products needed for compensating imbalances between supply and demand

	Balancing Market: allows merchants to purchase or sell additional energy for balancing their accounting grid. Typically, the only market partner is the TSO.

{Balancing and Reserve Markets}
In Europe, the {\it European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity,(ENTSO-E)} coordinates overarching grid topics. The main task of a TSO is to ensure a constant power frequency in the transmission system. The following control actions are applied

% begin itemize

	{\it Primary Reserve}   starts within seconds as a joined action of all TSOs in the system.

	{\it Secondary Reserve} replaces the primary reserve after a few minutes and is put into action by the responsible TSOs only.

	{\it Tertiary Reserve} frees secondary reserves by rescheduling generation by the responsible TSOs.

% end itemize

The TSO tenders the required products for fulfilling these functions. Reserve products may involve payments for the availability of the reserved capacity.

{Market Coupling}

% begin itemize

	Neighbouring electricity markets are typically coupled via transmission capacities owned by the TSOs.

	Transmission capacities can be integrated in the price finding algorithm of cooperating exchanges via implicit auctioning.

	With implicit auctions  players do not  receive allocations of cross-border capacity themselves but bid for energy on their Exchange. The Exchanges then use the available cross-border transmission capacity to minimize the price difference between two or more areas.

	Currently, the Central Western Europe (CWE) initiative couples Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Luxemburg.

{Electricity Markets}

A centralized platform where participants can exchange electricity transparently
according to the price they are will to pay or receive, and according to the capacity of
the electrical network.

% begin itemize

	Fixed Gate Auction

% begin itemize

	Participants submit sell or buy orders for several areas, several hours,

	the submissions are closed at a pre-specified time (closure)

	the market is cleared.

	Example: day-ahead.

% end itemize

	Continuous-time Auction

% begin itemize

	Participants continuously submit orders. Orders are stored,

	Each time a deal is feasible, it is executed,

	Example: intra-day.
